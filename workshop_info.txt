There
 
are
 
many
 
arguments
 
as
 
for
 
why
 
the
 
spacetime
 
continuum
 
of
 
general
 
relativity
 
will
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
replaced
 
by
 
some
 
discrete
 
structure.
 
Can
 
we
 
derive
 
this
 
structure
 
from
 
known
 
principles,
 
such
 
as
 
canonical
 
quantisation
 
à
 
la
 
loop
 
quantum
 
gravity,
 
or
 
does
 
it
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
postulated
 
ad
 
hoc?
 
Is
 
this
 
structure
 
going
 
to
 
come
 
from
 
a
 
quantum
 
theory
 
of
 
gravity,
 
or
 
from
 
a
 
theory
 
with
 
no
 
gravity
 
whatsoever?
 
Today
 
there
 
are
 
numerous
 
approaches
 
to
 
these
 
questions
 
drawing
 
influences
 
from
 
many
 
different
 
parts
 
of
 
physics,
 
from
 
different
 
approaches
 
to
 
quantum
 
gravity,
 
from
 
quantum
 
field
 
theory
 
and
 
string
 
theory,
 
and
 
from
 
pure
 
quantum
 
information
 
theory.
 
 
This
 
workshop’s
 
aim
 
is
 
to
 
bring
 
together
 
the
 
researchers
 
who
 
are
 
leading
 
efforts
 
in
 
this
 
research
 
direction,
 
to
 
have
 
them
 
present
 
their
 
work
 
to
 
this
 
nascent
 
but
 
still
 
fragmented
 
community.
 
Speakers
 
will
 
be
 
invited
 
to
 
highlight
 
the
 
conceptual
 
foundations
 
of
 
their
 
respective
 
approaches
 
as
 
much
 
as
 
their
 
concrete
 
progress.
 
What
 
aspects
 
of
 
general
 
relativity,
 
quantum
 
field
 
theory
 
and
 
quantum
 
mechanics
 
do
 
they
 
take
 
as
 
compelling
 
evidence
 
of
 
spacetime
 
not
 
being
 
fundamental?
 
What
 
concepts
 
or
 
structures
 
do
 
they
 
take
 
as
 
primitives
 
of
 
their
 
theory,
 
and
 
why?
 
 
 
 
As
 
the
 
topic
 
of
 
the
 
emergence
 
of
 
spacetime
 
raises
 
deep
 
philosophical
 
questions,
 
the
 
workshop
 
will
 
also
 
include
 
a
 
dedicated
 
session
 
with
 
philosophers
 
who
 
have
 
studied
 
these
 
issues.
  
We
 
anticipate
 
that
 
this
 
interdisciplinary
 
exchange
 
will
 
inspire
 
new
 
insights
 
and
 
foster
 
clarity
 
in
 
both
 
physics
 
and
 
philosophy.
 
To
 
maximize
 
collaboration,
 
the
 
workshop
 
will
 
feature
 
time
 
slots
 
specifically
 
reserved
 
for
 
open-ended
 
discussions,
 
where
 
participants
 
can
 
pursue
 
topics
 
and
 
questions
 
that
 
arise
 
during
 
talks
 
and
 
informal
 
interactions.
 
These
 
sessions
 
will
 
take
 
full
 
advantage
 
of
 
Nordita’s
 
excellent
 
facilities,
 
providing
 
a
 
flexible
 
environment
 
for
 
deeper
 
engagement.
 
By
 
bridging
 
fragmented
 
efforts
 
in
 
this
 
nascent
 
field,
 
this
 
workshop
 
seeks
 
to
 
create
 
lasting
 
connections
 
and
 
drive
 
progress
 
toward
 
a
 
deeper
 
understanding
 
of
 
spacetime
 
emergence.

Expected
 
total
 
number
 
of
 
participants
 
and
 
how
 
they
 
will
 
be
 
selected
 
(½
 
page)
 
 
We
 
could
 
do
 
half
 
invited
 
and
 
half
 
contributed,
 
i’d
 
keep
 
it
 
relatively
 
small
 
so
 
we
 
have
 
plenty
 
of
 
time
 
to
 
discuss.
 
We
 
also
 
want
 
to
 
have
 
some
 
students
 
as
 
they
 
might
 
get
 
more
 
excited
 
than
 

the
 
seniors
 
to
 
work
 
on
 
this
 
stuff,
 
or
 
try
 
to
 
merge
 
different
 
approaches
 
(less
 
ego
 
incentive
 
to
 
keep
 
your
 
little
 
approach
 
yours).

Amount
 
requested
 
+
 
budget
 
and
 
justification
 
(½
 
page)
 
 
 
We
 
could
 
consider
 
running
 
this
 
either
 
at
 
CIRM
 
(https://www.cirm-math.com/programmes.html)
 
near
 
Marseille
 
or
 
Fondations
 
Treilles
 
(
https://www.fondationdestreilles.com/en/research/research-workshops/
)
 
also
 
in
 
South
 
of
 
France,
 
which,
 
besides
 
being
 
a
 
gorgeous
 
locations,
 
also
 
offer
 
co-funding
 
(but
 
we
 
would
 
have
 
to
 
win
 
two
 
applications
 
of
 
course).
 
These
 
places
 
are
 
really
 
nice
 
especially
 
in
 
the
 
fall
 
or
 
early
 
spring
 
where
 
we
 
can
 
be
 
outside
 
in
 
quiet
 
environments.
 
 
Otherwise,
 
the
 
application
 
suggests
 
running
 
the
 
workshop
 
at
 
one
 
of
 
our
 
institutions.
 
In
 
this
 
case
 
i
 
suggest
 
Nordita
 
because
 
IQOQI
 
is
 
a
 
shit
 
place
 
to
 
run
 
a
 
workshop
 
(unless
 
we
 
try
 
to
 
rent
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
rooms
 
in
 
the
 
university
 
of
 
vienna
 
old
 
campus)

Invitation
 
to
 
the
 
EmerGe
 
Workshop
 
on
 
Emergent
 
Geometries
 
 
Dear
 
[Invited
 
speaker],
 
 
 
I
 
am
 
writing
 
on
 
behalf
 
of
 
the
 
Emergent
 
Geometries
 
(EmerGe)
 
collaboration.
 
We
 
are
 
applying
 
to
 
the
 
Gravity
 
Theory
 
Trust’s
 
call
 
to
 
organise
 
an
 
in-person
 
5-day
 
workshop
 
to
 
bring
 
together
 
leading
 
researchers
 
working
 
on
 
the
 
emergence
 
of
 
(semi-)classical
 
spacetime
 
from
 
fundamental
 
pre-
 
or
 
non-geometrical
 
quantum
 
structures,
 
alongside
 
philosophers
 
who
 
have
 
studied
 
the
 
topic
 
of
 
spacetime
 
emergence.
 
 
Given
 
your
 
seminal
 
work
 
on
 
[add
 
something
 
here]
 
we
 
would
 
be
 
thrilled
 
to
 
have
 
you
 
as
 
an
 
invited
 
speaker
 
at
 
the
 
workshop.
 
Please,
 
see
 
the
 
list
 
of
 
invited
 
speakers
 
below.
 
 
 
 
The
 
event
 
will
 
focus
 
on
 
presenting
 
and
 
discussing
 
the
 
diverse
 
approaches
 
to
 
the
 
emergence
 
of
 
spacetime,
 
emphasizing
 
their
 
conceptual
 
foundations
 
as
 
much
 
as
 
their
 
concrete
 
results.
 
Given
 
the
 
interdisciplinary
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
field,
 
the
 
workshop
 
will
 
feature
 
un
conference
 
time:
 
timeslots
 
reserved
 
for
 
blackboard
 
discussions
 
and
 
interactive
 
group
 
sessions
 
on
 
topics
 
arising
 
during
 
the
 
traditional
 
talks
 
format.
 
 
The
 
workshop
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
be
 
held
 
sometime
 
in
 
October
 
or
 
November
 
(depending
 
on
 
the
 
availability
 
of
 
the
 
speakers)
 
in
 
2025
 
at
 
the
 
Nordic
 
Institute
 
for
 
Theoretical
 
Physics
 
(NORDITA)
 
in
 
Stockholm.
 
 
We
 
hope
 
this
 
event
 
will
 
be
 
an
 
exciting
 
opportunity
 
to
 
spark
 
new
 
collaborations
 
and
 
deepen
 
understanding
 
in
 
this
 
field.
 

 
At
 
this
 
early
 
stage,
 
we
 
kindly
 
request
 
a
 
brief
 
statement
 
indicating
 
your
 
interest
 
and
 
availability
 
to
 
participate
 
as
 
an
 
invited
 
speaker,
 
should
 
our
 
application
 
be
 
successful.

Dear
 
Professors
 
Horowitz
 
and
 
Wiseman,
 
 
Greetings
 
and
 
good
 
wishes
 
for
 
the
 
new

call

organise
 
a
 
workshop
 
about
 
the
 
emergence
 
of
 
spacetime
 
from
 
pre-
 
or
 
non-geometric
 
structures.
 
 
The
 
event
 
will
 
involve
 
about
 
25
 
people,
 
both
 
physicists
 
and
 
philosophers.
 
We
 
aim
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
exploring
 
the
 
conceptual
 
foundations
 
of
 
the
 
field
 
by
 
comparing
 
and
 
contrasting
 
the
 
various
 
approaches
 
the
 
participants
 
work
 
on.
 
To
 
do
 
this,
 
we
 
will
 
have
 
about
 
4
 
talks
 
per
 
day
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
slots
 
to
 
discuss
 
in
 
smaller
 
groups.
 
 

The
 
response
 
by
 
the
 
prospective
 
invited
 
speakers
 
was
 
decidedly
 
positive,
 
and
 
we
 
are
 
quite
 
excited
 
for
 
the
 
possibility
 
to
 
run
 
this
 
workshop.
 
 
 
We
 
will
 
be
 
looking
 
forward
 
to
 
hearing
 
from
 
you.

Dear
 
…
 
 
 
We
 
are
 
very
 
pleased
 
to
 
inform
 
you
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
gotten
 
the
 
funds
 
from
 
the
 
Gravity
 
Theory
 
Trust's
 
call
 
needed
 
to
 
organize
 
the
 
5-day
 
in-person
 
workshop
 
on
 
Emergent
 
Geometries
 
at
 
Nordita,
 
Stockholm
 
in
 
November.
 
 
 
The
 
next
 
step
 
is
 
to
 
fix
 
the
 
dates.
 
Please,
 
reply
 
to
 
this
 
email
 
informing
 
us
 
which
 
of
 
the
 
following
 
weeks
 
works
 
the
 
best
 
for
 
you,
 
and
 
we
 
will
 
take
 
that
 
into
 
account
 
before
 
making
 
the
 
final
 
decision
 
for
 
the
 
dates.
